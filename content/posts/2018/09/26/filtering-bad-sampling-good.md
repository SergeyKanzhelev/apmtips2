This post gives an example on how to use adaptive sampling instead of filtering
on "noisy" telemetry and explains the benefits of this approach.

The idea of this post comes as a result of two conversations. First, on twitter on
[how to filter
out](https://twitter.com/AlexSorokoletov/status/1044751743719034880) fast
requests and dependency calls:

Second one is a [design discussion](https://github.com/census-instrumentation/opencensus-specs/pull/182/)
on sampling per endpoint url path for Open Census:

I'll give example in C# as this post adds a scenario to the [msdn article](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/mt808502.aspx). 
The same techniques can be used on any other language supported by Application
Insights.

## Idea

Application Insights collects information in form of C# object
`RequestTelemetry` and `DependencyTelemetry` about every incoming and outgoing
call to your app. This object is passed to the
[processing pipeline](https://github.com/microsoft/applicationinsights-dotnet#sdk-layering)
that will enrich it with an additional details or filter it out. This
approach requires to allocate an object and populate its properties for every
request, but it makes writing filters a straightforward task.

Let's implement a processor which aggressively samples fast incoming and
outgoing calls. First, let's filter out fast incoming requests. Processor is a
class inherited from the interface `ITelemetryProcessor`. This class should have
a constructor that takes another `ITelemetryProcessor` as an argument. When
pipeline will be instantiated - constructor will be called and the next
processor will be passed as a parameter. In a `Process` method then processor
decides whether to call `next.Process`. If it will be called - the next
processor will decide whether to pass an item further. If `next.Process` will
not be called - telemetry object will be lost.

The idea is to create a new `AdaptiveSamplingTelemetryProcessor` (which is one
of a standard processors) and pass `next` to its constructor. So that processor
will decide what to do with this telemetry object - either filter it our or pass
it to the `next`.

Basically, there will be fork for all telemetry - fast calls will go thru the
aggressive sampling processor. Slow calls - directly to the `next` one.

## Implementation

This is how code will look like:

``` csharp
internal class AggressivelySampleFastRequests : ITelemetryProcessor
{
  private readonly ITelemetryProcessor next;
  
  private readonly AdaptiveSamplingTelemetryProcessor samplingProcessor;

  public AggressivelySampleFastRequests(ITelemetryProcessor next)
  {
    this.next = next;
    this.samplingProcessor = new AdaptiveSamplingTelemetryProcessor(this.next);
  }
  
  public void Process(ITelemetry item)
  {
    // check the telemetry type and duration
    if (item is RequestTelemetry)
    {
      var d = item as RequestTelemetry;
      if (d.Duration < TimeSpan.FromMilliseconds(500))
      {
        // let sampling processor decide what to do
        // with this fast incoming request
        this.samplingProcessor.Process(item);
        return;
      }
    }

    // in all other cases simply call next
    this.next.Process(item);
  }
}
```

Further customization of a processor might include adjusting
`AdaptiveSamplingTelemetryProcessor` parameters like this:

``` csharp
this.samplingProcessor = new AdaptiveSamplingTelemetryProcessor(this.next)
{
    ExcludedTypes = "Event", // exclude custom events from being sampled
    MaxTelemetryItemsPerSecond = 1, // default: 5 calls/sec
    SamplingPercentageIncreaseTimeout = TimeSpan.FromSeconds(1), // default: 2 min
    SamplingPercentageDecreaseTimeout = TimeSpan.FromSeconds(1), // default: 30 sec
    EvaluationInterval = TimeSpan.FromSeconds(1), // default: 15 sec
    InitialSamplingPercentage = 25, // default: 100%
};
```

And making threshold `TimeSpan.FromMilliseconds(500)` configurable.

Similar code can be implemented for outgoing calls processing. And those two
processors can be chained together:

``` csharp
configuration.TelemetryProcessorChainBuilder
    .Use((next) => { return new AggressivelySampleFastRequests(next); })
    .Use((next) => { return new AggressivelySampleFastDependencies(next); })
    .Build();
```

Interestingly you can chain those two processors with the regular adaptive
sampling processor. Fast calls will not be processed by final
`AdaptiveSamplingTelemetryProcessor` as they will already be marked as
sampled-in. Only slow requests and slow dependencies will be analyzed by the
global processor.

``` csharp
configuration.TelemetryProcessorChainBuilder
    .Use((next) => { return new AggressivelySampleFastRequests(next); })
    .Use((next) => { return new AggressivelySampleFastDependencies(next); })
    .Use((next) => { return new AdaptiveSamplingTelemetryProcessor(next); })
    .Build();
```

## Results and benefits

So how the collected telemetry will look like? To illustrate it, I'd assume that
fast requests and fast dependencies processors only preserved 5% of telemetry
representing fast calls and global sampler preserved 20% of telemetry. I
included this demo into
[Azure-Samples](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/application-insights-dotnet-data-reduction/blob/master/ApplicationInsightsDataROI/Demo7.cs)
repository.

When you will analyze telemetry for this app, you will probably start with slow
requests. You will find that all collected incoming requests have information
about all slow outgoing calls. You may also discover that while browsing Azure
portal in many cases you will see examples of slow incoming requests with both -
slow and fast requests collected.

![](../images/2018-09-26-filtering-bad-sampling-good/suggested-slow-request.png)

The reason for this is that adaptive sampling is using probability sampling
algorithm to decide on sampling decision. If sampling score is lower than 20% -
slow request and dependencies will be collected. Is sampling score is lower than
5% - fast dependencies will also be collected.

Azure portal highlights examples with lowest sampling score as the most
interesting to analyze. This is why you will get many useful samples
with all the details. When you scroll down or randomly will open examples - you
will see many of them with slow dependency only collected.

![](../images/2018-09-26-filtering-bad-sampling-good/other-slow-request.png)

In a given conditions all collected fast requests will have the details on all
the fast dependency calls. Again, browsing those may be useful.

Here I should note that end-to-end transaction view that spans across many
components will follow the same principles. If sampling percentages of collected
telemetry generally the same and algorithms on deciding on cohorts (thresholds to decide
slow vs. fast) is similar - there always would be examples of
end-to-end execution. I might write more about it the next time.

There are many other benefits on aggressive sampling versus filtering than
preserving 5% of end-to-end transaction views.

Application map will be more complete. With filtering out fast dependencies, you
may filter out knowledge about the entire service you depend on if it runs fast.

Endpoint url path will be discoverable on performance page in Azure portal. You
will be able to catch problems with major performance degradation of those. If
calls that used to take 10 ms will start taking 200 ms - this change will be
visible on chart even on 5% of telemetry. And it will likely be caught by smart
detectors of Application Insights.

![](../images/2018-09-26-filtering-bad-sampling-good/count-gained-up.png)

Latency problems caused by multiple calls to the fast dependent service will be
caught - there probably be examples of those in the collected 5%.

## Summary

ROI of monitoring is not a simple topic. You can collect tons of logs and traces
and have no clue when something goes wrong. Or a single trace may give you
information on root cause of a major app slowdown. Every time you filter out
telemetry - you are loosing a signal that might have saved your day.

Application Insights allows a lot of flexibility in data processing
configuration. So you can save on COGS and preserve some of the signal. Use it!
